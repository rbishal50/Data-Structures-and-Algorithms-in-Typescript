## Reverse Polish Notation

### Description

You're given a list of string tokens representing a mathematical expression using Reverse Polish Notation.
Reverse Polish Notation is a notation where operators come after operands, instead of between them. For example 2 4 + would evaluate to 6.
Parenthesis are always implicit in Reverse Polish Notation, meaning an expression is evaluated from left to right. All of the operators for this problem take two operands, which will always be the two values immediately preceding the operator. For example, 18 4 - 7 / would evaluate to ((18 - 4) / 7) or 2.

Write a function that takes this list of tokens and returns the result. Your function should support four operators: `+, -, *, /` for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division respectively.
Division should always be treated as integer division, rounding towards zero. For example, 3 / 2 evaluates to 1 and -3 / 2 evaluates to -1 . You can assume the input will always be valid Reverse Polish Notation, and it will always result in a valid number. Your code should not edit this input list.

## Signature

```typescript
function reversePolishNotation(tokens: string[]): number;
```
