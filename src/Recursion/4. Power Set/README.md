## Power set

Write a function that takes in an array of unique integers and returns its power set. The power set of a set X is the set of all possible subsets of X. Each subset can contain any combination of elements from the original array. For example, the power set of [1, 2] would be [[], [1], [2], [1, 2]], representing all possible combinations of subsets for the input array.

### Signature

```typescript
function powerSet(array: number[]): number[][];
```
