## Best Seat

You walk into a theatre to see a show, and the usher tells you that you're allowed to sit anywhere within the given row. You want to sit in the seat that gives you the most space and is evenly distributed on either side of you. You may assume that someone is always sitting in the first and last seat of the row. Return the seat index of where you should sit.

**Note**: Whenever there are two equally good seats, you should sit in the seat with the lower index. The given array will always have a length of at least one and contain only ones and zeroes. If there is no seat to sit in, return -1.
