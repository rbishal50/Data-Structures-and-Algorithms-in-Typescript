## Missing Numbers

You're given an unordered list of unique integers `array` in the range [1, n], where n represents the length of `array` + 2. This means that two numbers in this range are missing from the list. Write a function that takes in this list `array` and returns a new list with the two missing numbers, sorted numerically.

### Signature

```typescript
function missingNumbers(array: number[]): number[];
```
