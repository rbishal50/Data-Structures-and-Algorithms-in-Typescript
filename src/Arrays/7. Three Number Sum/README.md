## Three Number Sum

### Description

In this problem, you are given a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target sum. The function should find all triplets in the array whose elements sum up to the target sum. It should then return a two-dimensional array containing all these triplets. Each triplet should consist of three integers from the array and should be ordered in ascending order. Furthermore, the triplets themselves should be ordered in ascending order based on the numbers they contain.

### Signature

```typescript
function threeNumberSum(array: number[], targetSum: number): number[][];
```
