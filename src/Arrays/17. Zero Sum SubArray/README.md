## Zero Sum SubArray

You're given a list of integers numbers. Write a function that returns a boolean representing whether there exists a zero-sum sub array of numbers.

**Note**: A zero-sum sub array is any sub array where all of the values add up to zero. A sub array is any contiguous section of the array. For the purposes of this problem, a sub array can be as small as one element and as long as the original array.

### Signature

```typescript
function hasZeroSumSubArray(array: number[]): boolean;
```
