## Move Elements to the End

You are given an array of integers and an integer value. Write a function that moves all instances of that integer in the array to the end of the array and returns the modified array.

**Note**: The function should perform this in place (i.e., it should mutate the input array) and doesn't need to maintain the order of the other integers.

### Signature

```typescript
function moveElementsToTheEnd(array: number[], numToMove: number): number[];
```
