## Spiral Traverse

Write a function that takes in an n x m two-dimensional array (which can be square-shaped when n == m) and returns a one-dimensional array of all the array's elements in spiral order. Spiral order traversal starts at the top left corner of the two-dimensional array, goes to the right, and proceeds in a spiral pattern all the way until every element has been visited.

**Note**: - The input array will always be a non-empty two-dimensional array.

### Signature

```typescript
function spiralTraverse(matrix: number[][]): number[];
```
