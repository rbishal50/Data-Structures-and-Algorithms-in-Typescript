## Find Closest Pair

Write a function that takes in two non-empty arrays of integers and returns a pair of numbers (one from each array) whose absolute difference is closest to zero. The function should return an array containing these two numbers, with the number from the first array in the first position. It is guaranteed that there will be only one pair of numbers with the smallest difference.

**Note**: The absolute difference of two integers is the distance between them on the real number line. For example, the absolute difference of -5 and 5 is 10, and the absolute difference of -5 and -4 is 1.

### Signature

```typescript
function smallestDifference(array1: number[], array2: number[]): number[];
```
