## Remove Duplicates from Linked List

### Description

You're given the head of a Singly Linked List whose nodes are in sorted order with respect to their values. Write a function that returns a modified version of the Linked List that doesn't contain any nodes with duplicate values. The Linked List should be modified in place (i.e., you shouldn't create a brand new list), and the modified Linked List should still have its nodes sorted with respect to their values.

## Signature

```typescript
export class LinkedList {
  value: number;
  next: LinkedList | null;

  constructor(value: number) {
    this.value = value;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

export function removeDuplicatesFromLinkedList(
  linkedList: LinkedList
): LinkedList | null;
```
